# High Fidelty Prototype - Task Manager  

## A prototype task manager created from designs created in Pencil. The user can add their tasks to the appropriate category, and then view the task in 2 ways they would like. The prototpe is then anaylsed in depth against the usability heuristics.  

* Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
* Bootstrap was used to make the design layout simple.
* Local storage used to store the task data, no database required.
* Simple red and blue colour scheme used, to keep the task manager simple and not overwhelming.
* Dark and light mode added for the users preference.
* The report (CW2 Portfolio) anaylses the prototype UI components.
* Ran a usability test with different users of various ages and careers.


## How it works and looks.

## How to run.  

### Prerequisites  

* Visual Studio Code or preferred code editor that can launch a preview of HTML, CSS and JS projects.
* A desktop browser like Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc.

## Running it

1. Clone the project or download the folder code.  
2. Open the project in your chosen editor.
3. Now open the Index.html page, and then launch the project in a live server.
    * For VS Code install the extension, Live Server by Ritwick Dey.
    * Once install, on the bottom right there will be a button to launch the application in a server.

    *  This will allow you to preview the project in a server ran on your computer, like a normal webpage.
      
*Note: Since this was just a prototype, some features have not fully been implemented like the login feature, as I had only wanted to see how the task manager would work.*
